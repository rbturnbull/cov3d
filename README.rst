A deep learning model to detect the presence and severity of COVID19 in patients from CT-scans. 
It has been submitted as part of the workshop `'AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis â€“ Digital Pathology & Radiology/COVID19 (MIA-COV19D)' <https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/eccv-2022-ai-mia/>`_
at the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) in 2022.

.. warning::

    This project is part of a computer vision competition and has not been released for clinical use.

Installation
==================================

Install cov3d with pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/rbturnbull/cov3d.git

Training
==================================

To train cov3d, use this command:

.. code:: bash

    cov3d train --directory <path/to/uncompressed/training/files> --directory ../ --training-csv train_partition_covid_categories.csv --validation-csv val_partition_covid_categories.csv

The training data and the two CSV files are part of the COV19-CT-DB Database which is available from MIA-COV19D workshop team.

More options for training the model can be seen with the command:

.. code:: bash

    cov3d train --help

Inference
==================================

If you have a trained model, you can infer the presence and severity of COVID19 from a CT scan with the command:

.. code:: bash

    cov3d infer --pretrained <path/to/model> --scan <path/to/ct-scan>

More options for inference can be found with the command:

.. code:: bash

    cov3d infer --help
