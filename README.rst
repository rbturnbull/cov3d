A deep learning model to detect the presence and severity of COVID19 in patients from CT-scans. 
It has been submitted as part of the workshop `'AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis â€“ Digital Pathology & Radiology/COVID19 (MIA-COV19D)' <https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/eccv-2022-ai-mia/>`_
at the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) in 2022.

.. warning::

    This project is part of a computer vision competition and has not been released for clinical use.

The following is a quick introduction to running cov3d. For more detailed information, 
see the `documentation <https://rbturnbull.github.io/cov3d/>_` and the accompanying paper.

.. start-quickstart

Installation
==================================

Install cov3d with pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/rbturnbull/cov3d.git

Training
==================================

To train cov3d, use this command:

.. code:: bash

    cov3d train --directory ./scans --training-csv train_partition_covid_categories.csv --validation-csv val_partition_covid_categories.csv

The training data and the two CSV files are part of the COV19-CT-DB Database which is available from MIA-COV19D workshop team.

The default hyperparameters for training can be overridden using the command-line interface. 
All options for training the model can be seen with the command:

.. code:: bash

    cov3d train --help

Also see the training options in the `Command Line Interface documentation <https://rbturnbull.github.io/cov3d/cli.html#cov3d-train>`_.

Inference
==================================

If you have a trained model, you can infer the presence and severity of COVID19 from a CT scan with the command:

.. code:: bash

    cov3d infer --pretrained <path/to/model> --scan <path/to/ct-scan>

All options for inference can be found with the command:

.. code:: bash

    cov3d infer --help

Also see the inference options in the `Command Line Interface documentation <https://rbturnbull.github.io/cov3d/cli.html#cov3d-infer>`_.
